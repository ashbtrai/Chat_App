 goole fonts : [link](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)

Today we gonna build messing/chat app #ui using #flutter that runs both Android and iOS devices also has a dark and light theme. We create in total 4 screens all of that support both Dark Theme and Light Theme. At first, we design a welcome screen that contains an image with a tag line also has a skip button. Once the user press, its transfers to the Sign-in or Sign-up screen. The last two screens are the main screen, Chats screens it shows the list of people you are chated with. At the end message screen which support text message, audio message, and video messages.

Note - The desired images should be downloaded and copied into the image and icon asset inside the code. And this doesnot contain the entire code for the app. Its just a basic outline. The entire code can be found in my youtube channel.
